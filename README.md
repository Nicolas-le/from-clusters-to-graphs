**Abstract**
In this short paper, we present a novel approach that combines density-based clustering and graph modeling to create a scalable viewing application for the exploration of similarity patterns in news videos.
Unlike most existing video analysis tools that focus on individual videos, our approach allows for an overview of a larger collection of videos, which can be further examined based on their connections or communities. By utilizing scalable reading, specific subgraphs can be selected from the overview and their respective clusters can be explored in more detail on the video frame level.

Due to copyright reasons of the news video data which was analyzed in the paper cannot be made public. However, the code of the visualization should help to reproduce the visualization.

To visualize the graph you need a data strcture such as ```/src/app/graph_communities_corr.json``` which is a saved [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graph. How the graph is exported can be found in ```/src/data_handling/graph.py```.

Additionaly, you should locate up to 80 images for each of the clusters in the folder ```/src/app/hdbscan_clusters/```. File names should be structure like "(clusterID)_(increamenting number).jpg" (for cluster 0: 0_0.jpg, 0_1.jpg, ...).

Afterwards you could adapt ```/src/app/backend.py``` with your file path and start backend.py in an environment with the dependcies installed.

## Creating the Datastructure

The prototype should be perceived as a conceptual framework rather than a pre-packaged tool that is immediately usable for all video collections. Nevertheless, both the concept and the code in this repository are flexible and can be tailored to meet individual requirements. The concept was originally conceived to facilitate the practicality of scalable viewing for various application scenarios.

```/src/data_handling/main.py``` contains every major parameter. The code works with previously calculated CLIP embeddings of the video corpus and their associated images, in this case BASE64 encoded.
